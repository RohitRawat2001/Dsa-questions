Problem statement
You are given an array ‘Arr’ of size ‘N’ consisting of positive integers.

Make a linked list from the array and return the head of the linked list.

The head of the linked list is the first element of the array, and the tail of the linked list is the last element.
Note:
In the output, you will see the elements of the linked list made by you.


Example:
Input: ‘Arr’ = [4, 2, 5, 1]

Output: 4 2 5 1

Explanation: Linked List for the array ‘Arr’ = [4, 2, 5, 1] is 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1.

public class Solution {
    public static Node constructLL(int []arr) {
         Node head = new Node(arr[0]);
        Node temp=head;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < arr.length;i++){
            Node temp1=new Node(arr[i]);
            temp.next=temp1;
            temp=temp1;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
